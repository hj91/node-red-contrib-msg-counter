    <p>This node counts the number of messages that pass through it. It sends the message as a JSON payload 
    which includes the message's payload, topic, and the current count. If the node receives a message with 
    the topic 'resetCounter', it resets the counter to 0. If it receives a message with the topic 'msgCount', 
    it sends a message with the count value in the payload.</p>
